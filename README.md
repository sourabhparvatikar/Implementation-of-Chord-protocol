        1. Unzip the file 
        2. A directory will be created with name "chord"
        3. Goto chord directory and run:
                elixir chord.ex <number of nodes> <number of requests>

           Output:
                Average hop count

What is working
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        We have set m as 30. For each node/process, random node_id will be generated by sha1 hashing of a randomly generated string. It makes sure that the number is < 2^m. Network is setup based on the number of nodes argument. Finger tables are updated for every node. Each node will send number of requests asynchronously for random keys with a one request per second. After every node has completed sending those mamny requests, total number of hops will be calculated. Average hop count will be calculated by dividing the total number of hops by number of nodes times number of requests. Rest of the code is developed using the details provided in the paper.
